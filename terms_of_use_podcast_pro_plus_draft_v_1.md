You may provide feedback or suggestions; you grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use them without restriction.

Your use of the Service is subject to our **[Privacy Policy URL]**, which explains how we collect, use, and share information. Where required by law (e.g., California, EU/UK), you may have certain rights over your personal data. Please review the Privacy Policy for details.

## 9) Disclaimers
THE SERVICE AND ALL OUTPUTS ARE PROVIDED **"AS IS"** AND **"AS AVAILABLE."** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

## 10) Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, **OUR TOTAL LIABILITY** FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE **WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID TO US IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY** OR **$100** IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID ANY AMOUNTS. WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL.

## 13) Changes to the Service or Terms
We may update the Service and these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice (e.g., by email or in-product). Changes take effect upon posting or as otherwise stated. Your continued use after changes become effective means you accept the updated Terms.

These Terms are governed by the laws of the **State of California**, without regard to its conflict of laws rules.

**Arbitration & Class Action Waiver.** Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service will be resolved by **binding arbitration** administered by the **American Arbitration Association (AAA)** under its **Consumer Arbitration Rules**, as modified by these Terms. Arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator in **Los Angeles County, California**, or remotely by video conference if the arbitrator permits. **You and we both waive any right to a jury trial and to participate in a class action, class arbitration, or representative proceeding.**

Either party may bring an individual action in **small claims court** in Los Angeles County, California, instead of arbitration. This Section does not prevent either party from seeking **injunctive or equitable relief** in a court of competent jurisdiction to protect intellectual property or prevent unauthorized use of the Service.

If any part of this Section is found unenforceable, the remainder will still apply, and the unenforceable part will be severed to the minimum extent necessary.

## 16) Communications
You consent to receive service-related communications electronically (e.g., emails, in-app messages). You may opt out of non-essential marketing emails.

## 17) Miscellaneous
If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect. You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent; we may assign them as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets. These Terms (plus any referenced policies) are the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service and supersede prior agreements.
